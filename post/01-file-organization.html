    <h1>1. Develop File Naming Convention</h1>
    <p>
      Main identifier of a file reflects file content without ambiguity.
      Included:
    </p>
    <li>File type; Images, Word, Excels, PPT&#39;s, and more</li>
    <li>File Format Extensions; TIFF, XLS, DOC, PDF, and many more</li>
    <li>Naming Schema; YYMMDD_ExpCode `or` YYYYMMDD_ExpCode_V1.docx</li>
    <li>Example: 230423_Design.psd</li>
    <h3>File Naming Convention: Best Practices</h3>

    <pre>

- Lenght
  - Avoid Long Names (Remove unnecessary elements)
  - Use Code & Acronyms
- Special Characters
  - No Spaces
  - Avoid Special Character: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & \* ( ) ` ; < > ? , { } ‘ “
  - Use Underscores and Camelcase instead (e.g: Date_Name.psd or DateName.psd)
- Date
  - Use ISO8601; YYYMMDD (e.g: 20230314_name.txt)
- Numbering
  - Use leading zeroes for sequential numbering fo multi version control
  - e.g: NameDate001.txt, NameDate010.txt, an others

## 2. Folder Structure

Where we place files in a folder that makes it easy for anyone to find them. and its must be:

- Avoid Overlaping Categories and Folder Redundance (Maximum 5 folders deep)
- Find Balance: Folders not too large VS not too deep
- Follow file naming guidlines for folders that reflects folder contents

## 3. Version Control System (VCS)

### **Manual Change Log**

- **File Name:** e.g: 20230405_filename.txt or filename_v2.txt
- **File Header:** Locate the version log in the header
- **Change Log File:** You can create a Changelog file to control the version of your file
- **Version Table:** There&#39;s third party app that can automatically track the version history of the file

### Automatic Change Log

- Version Control System functionalities in Cloud Storage platform
- Use Version Control System like GIT, GitHub, and GitLab.

## File Organization: Final Tips

- Plan file organization at beginning of the project; Develop a file naming convention decide on your folder structure and how you will approach version control.
- Document your decision; this way you and people you work with can easily adopt the rules you have set up
- Apply your file organization rules consistently
